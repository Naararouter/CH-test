Generally, we will need the next steps:
1. Add the 'customId' field to the database table Agents.
2. We need to provide a possibility for facilities to update this field via front-end.
2.1. I assume we already have some basic CRUD functionality for Agents in the scope of each Facility.
2.2. So we only need to add a UI-field to create/edit form.
3. As far as I can understand, we have an option to skip specifying of the custom id, in this case,
the default database id (the old behaviour) should be used. So we need to extend our current generating report feature
by adding a usage of new field in the case if it's provided.

Based on this, we can split the tickets out from points 1, 2.2, 3:
- Ticket #1: DB: Add the optional 'customId' field to the table Agents.
-- The field must be optional to avoid any breaking changes.
-- Time: 1h? The operation is quite trivial, but maybe, we need some additional time to execute DB migration for our
environments.

- Ticket #2: FE: Create a "Custom ID" field.
-- Assume, we already have some established flow and libraries to implement the feature quite quickly. Since the field
is optional, no especial validation rules is applied. Need to add the UI, bind it with internal form library if we have
and ensure we sent this new property to the back-end side correctly. We also need to update our test-cases.
-- Time: 1h? The operation is quite trivial, but heavily depends on existing front-end structure.

- Ticket #3: PDF-Service: Get new "Custom ID" field if it's present.
-- Implementation of this ticket strongly depends on where exactly we put our pdf generation logic. In easy cases, it could be
a front-end side, and I believe it could be implemented in the scope of task #2 since it should be an extremely fast. For
some complex cases BE support could be required, but our case is quite simple at the moment and FE generation should be enough.
But generally it should contain something like: `generatePDF(agent.customId || agent.dbId, ...someAdditionalArgs)`.
We also need to update our test-cases.
-- Time: 1h? Generally, the change is quite trivial, but heavily depends on existing infrastructure.

- Optional: Ticket #4: QA: Test "Custom ID" field
-- Sorry, almost out of time to describe it properly =)
-- Time: 2h?
